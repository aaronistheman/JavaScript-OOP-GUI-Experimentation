# JavaScript-OOP-GUI-Experimentation

About
-----

I used this repository in the fall of 2015 (during my freshman year
in college) to experiment with some custom types that would help me
design a GUI for a canvas-based application. Thus, I used JavaScript.

The results of this experimentation will mainly help me in my work
on my Deal-or-Smarter-Than-a-Millionaire-SpongeBob-Edition project.

The repository includes, among other things, a few custom types that
inherit from a single custom type.

Releases
--------

I'm not making a release in this repository, for it was for experimentation.

How to Run Main Webpage
-----------------------

To run the main webpage that uses some of the custom types, run index.html
on any browser that supports canvas content.

How to Run Unit Tests
---------------------

Run unit-tests.html on any browser that supports QUnit.
According to the QUnit website, the following
browsers support unit testing with QUnit:
"IE6+ and Current - 1 for Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera."

Use of Git Hooks
----------------

To prevent trailing whitespace, I've enabled the pre-commit Git hook.
However, this change can't be saved in the repository. To make this
change, navigate to the directory .git/hooks, and rename "pre-commit.sample"
to "pre-commit".

Acknowledgements
----------------

The book "The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript" by Nicholas
C. Zakas helped greatly. "jQuery Game Development Essentials" by
Selim Arsever also helped.
