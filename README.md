# JavaScript-OOP-GUI-Experimentation

This is a repository that I am using to experiment with some classes in designing a GUI. I will also focus on learning how I might deal with inheritance and abstract classes and methods in JavaScript.

The book "The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript" helped greatly.
