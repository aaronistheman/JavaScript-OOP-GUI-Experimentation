-create class MenuState
    --implement the drawing functionality of the classes that need it
        --draw Button through the MenuState's draw function (and thus
            through Container's draw function)
        --redraw button's text when it's selected or deselected
    --create some sample combinations of the GUI classes; draw
        them on canvas
        --draw the other components
-implement MenuState.enableInput() to allow arrow keys
-improve the look of the drawn GUI components
