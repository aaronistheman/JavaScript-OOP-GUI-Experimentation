-create class MenuState
    --allow MenuState to function also under the assumption that the
        images loaded instantly (so onload wouldn't be triggered)
-implement MenuState.enableInput() to allow arrow keys
    --redraw button's text when it's selected or deselected
    --make sure only selectable components can be selected
-improve the look of the drawn GUI components
-make a thorough readme?
